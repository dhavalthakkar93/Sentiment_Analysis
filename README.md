# Sentiment_Analysis
I Used SentimentAnalysis Techniques To Analyze The Reviews Given By Customer So Based On The Positive Review We Can Display Or Provide Offer To The Customer That May Increse The Conversion Ratio Because Customer Will Get What They Like

I Used 2 Datasets 

1. Test Data ---- That Contains Some Reviews Given By Customer
2. Training Data --- That Contain Sentiment (Good Or Bad) And Training Texts

So I Developed The Model That Will Aalyze The Data And Based On It Made Decision Like It Is Good Review Or Bad Review


Result Generated By Model On Test Data

Test Sentense 					Sentiment (Decision)
-------------------------------			--------------------
1.San Francisco Coffee rocks, yo!			1
2.By the way, I hate LONDON...			    0
3.I love Boston too!				        			1
4.And San Francisco was good.				1
5.I miss Shanghai.					1


So Here We Get 4 Good Reviews And 1 Bad Review Of Customer So We Can Show Offers For San Fransisco,Boston,Shanghai To The Customer Because From Sentimental Analysis We Predict This 4 Place Attract That Perticular Customer
